        <h4>My Journey</h4>
        <p>With a master's degree in counseling from Laval University and membership in the Order of Counselors and Career Counselors of Quebec,
            I have always been dedicated to helping people find meaning in their lives, regardless of limitations or personal experiences.<br><br>
            My journey in counseling began within an employee assistance program, where I provided telephone support and conducted suicide risk assessments.
            I then worked with a homeless clientele facing multiple issues such as mental health, addiction, prostitution, and criminality.
            Having an interest in rehabilitation for social, physical, and career-related aspects, I later transitioned to a probation officer role, before dedicating myself to the rehabilitation of Canadian veterans facing physical and mental health problems.
            For the past few years, I have been offering counseling services in career guidance and personal counseling within Employee Assistance Programs to assist a diverse clientele with their personal and professional challenges.<br><br>
            My journey has allowed me to acquire strong skills in mental health, crisis management, and post-traumatic stress disorders.
            I am dedicated to supporting my clients in their challenges and use my experience to provide tailored support for each situation. My goal is to help each person find sustainable solutions and restore balance in their lives.
